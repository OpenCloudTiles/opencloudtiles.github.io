OpenCloudTiles will be an open stack for generating and deploying map tiles.

The architecture looks like this:

The goal is that the stack can be used in different way:

1. **Experts** can copy the entire process chain and set it up as their own infrastructure in order to be completely independent.

2. The **simplest option** is to offer a completely free map server that is free of charge for everyone. However, there is still the open question of long-term financing, especially of the traffic costs. Either we find sponsors, a long-term public funding or regular crowdfunding.

3. The **interim solution** is to build or rent your own CDN to mirror the central map server, so that individuals or communities can bear the traffic costs themselves.
